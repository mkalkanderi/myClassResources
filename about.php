    <h2>Sharing is caring!</h2>
    <P>
        My Class Resources is a website that lets AUK students share and view class resources from each other.
        The idea is that many studetns can help others by simply sharing a note that took for a class, a website link
        that they might see helpfull for their fellow classmates. in doing so, we will be able to create a community
        that embraces learning through sharing and helping each other.
